# Reesha: An Online Art Gallery Empowering Artists
## Motivation
Reesha is designed to support artists by providing an online gallery that not only showcases their work but also offers a fair and accessible platform for sales. Unlike traditional galleries, Reesha incorporates an auction feature that allows artists to gain more value for their work without making it the primary focus. This project serves as a learning experience in e-commerce platform development, user engagement strategies, and the intersection of technology and the art market. Through this, we aim to create a space where artists can reach a broader audience while maintaining control over their creative and financial success.
