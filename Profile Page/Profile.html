            <p class="bio">I’m a passionate artist dedicated to capturing the beauty of the world around me. My work often reflects my emotions, using vibrant colors and expressive brushstrokes. I find inspiration in nature, everyday life, and the people I encounter. Despite facing many challenges, I strive to convey depth and meaning through my art. My journey may be tumultuous, but my love for painting drives me forward. Thank you for exploring my work.

                    <p>Description: A burst of green and pink, wild and untamed. The roses, painted in thick strokes, feel alive—growing, reaching. Even within the asylum walls, nature’s beauty flourishes. I let the colors carry me beyond confinement.</p>

                    <p>Description: A simple meal, shared by those who work the land. Their hands, rough and calloused, have dug the very potatoes they now eat. The dim light reveals their worn faces—hard lives, but honest ones. I painted not elegance, but truth.</p>
